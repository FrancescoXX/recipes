# Zerops recipes repository
Contains descriptions and import YAML structures for all Zerops recipes (example apps and open source software — each with environments setups covering the whole development lifecycle). Applications (and their build and deploy configurations — `zerops.yaml`) used within these recipes have their own GitHub org [zerops-recipe-apps](https://github.com/zerops-recipe-apps).
