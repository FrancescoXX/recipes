  # Deploy the app even for the 'local' setup,

  # and deployed app's behavior. The enabled Zerops subdomain
  # allows us to test the app via HTTPS.
  # Typical development workflow in 'local' environment
  # includes running and testing the app locally
  # and then deploying it via zCLI or Git push integration
  # into this Zerops staging service.

  # The app requires a database. Create a PostgreSQL database
  # in single node setup with close to minimal default resources.
  # You would typically connect to the database locally
  # over zCLI Zerops VPN, which would make the database accessible
  # on its hostname 'db' or 'db.zerops'. So you would connect
  # the same as the above staging service would.
